                        The objective is to fill the 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the
                        nine 3×3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. For more information regarding Sudoku,

                        This game is in a very early stage of development; lots of things may be broken, misbehaving, or
                        simply not be implemented yet. This page is an early demo that does not capture the full scope
                        of the project.

                    <h2>Controls</h2>
                    <p>
                        Besides using a <strong>mouse</strong>, you can use <strong>Arrow Keys</strong>, <strong>W / A /
                        S / D</strong>, or (if you're familiar with VIM-like navigation) <strong>H / J / K / L</strong> 
                        to move the cursor by a single cell. Holding <strong>Shift</strong> while pressing any direction
                        key will move the cursor over by a box.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If any are errors are present on the grid, pressing <strong>E</strong> will cause the cursor to
                        cycle through them. <strong>Shift + E</strong> can be used to move in the opposite direction.
                        Alternatively, <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Shift + X</strong> cycle through the errors
                        while clearing the erronous cells of value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using <strong>Backspace</strong> or <strong>Delete</strong> will clear the current cell of its
                        value. If there is no value it will clear all marked candidates.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>YAWS</strong> is a personal project to create a modern and functional web-based sudoku
                        game using standard browser technologies. It is able to solve and generate challenging puzzles 
                        in a consistant manner via the use of <a href="https://webassembly.org/">Web Assembly</a> for
                        its core code. The user interface was created using standard HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript 
                        techniques.
